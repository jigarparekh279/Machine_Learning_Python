    "Unfortunately, gradients often get smaller and smaller as the backprop algorithm progresses down to the lower layers. As a result, the Gradient Descent update leaves the lower layer's connection weights virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good solution. We call this the **vanishing gradients** problem. In some cases, the opposite can happen: the gradients can grow bigger and bigger until layers get insanely large weight updates and the algorithm diverges. This is the **exploding gradients** problem, which surfaces in recurrent neural networks. More generally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers may learn at widely different speeds.\n",

    "Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio in 2010 paper) showed that the combination of the popular _logistic sigmoid_ activation function and the weight initialization technique of a _normal distribution_ with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 results in variance of the outputs of each layer being much greater than the variance of its inputs. Going forward in the network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the activation function saturates at the top layers. This saturation is actually made worse by the fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0 (the hyperbolic tangent function has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly better than the logistic function in deep networks). Looking at the logistic activation function, you can see that when inputs become large (negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a derivative extremely close to 0. Thus, when backpropagation kicks in it has virtually no gradient to propagate back through the network; and what little gradient exists keeps getting diluted as backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so there is really nothing left for the lower layers."

    "The signal should flow properly in both directions: in the forward direction when making predictions, and in the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients. We don't want the signal to die out, nor do we want it to explode and saturate. For the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of its inputs, and we need the gradients to have equal variance before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction.  It is actually not possible to guarantee both unless the layer has an equal number of inputs and neurons (these numbers are called the fan-in and fan-out of the layer), but Glorot and Bengio proposed a good compromise that has proven to work very well in practice: the connection weights of each layer must be initialized randomly: \n",

    "One of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that the problems with unstable gradients were in part due to a poor choice of activation function. Until then most people had assumed that if Mother Nature had chosen to use roughly sigmoid activation functions in biological neurons, they must be an excellent choice. But it turns out that other activation functions behave much better in deep neural networks -- in particular, the **ReLU** activation function, _mostly because it does not saturate for positive values and because it is fast to compute_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** - Unfortunately, the ReLU activation function is not perfect. It suffers from a problem known as the _dying ReLUs_: during training, some neurons (for any input) effectively **die**, meaning they stop outputting anything other than 0. In some cases, you may find that half of your network's neurons are dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. A neuron dies when its weights get tweaked in such a way that the weighted sum of its inputs are negative for all instances in the training set. When this happens, it just keeps outputting zeros, and Gradient Descent does not affect it anymore because the gradient of the ReLU function is zero when its input is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOLN** - To solve this problem, you may want to use a variant of the ReLU function, such as the leaky ReLU. This function is defined as $LeakyReLU_{\\alpha}(z) = max(\\alpha z, z)$. The hyperparameter $\\alpha$ defines how much the function **leaks**: it is the slope of the  function for $z < 0$ and is typically set to 0.01. This small slope ensures that leaky ReLUs never die; they can go into a long coma, but they have a chance to eventually wake up.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _randomized leaky ReLU_ (RReLU), where $\\alpha$ is picked randomly in a given range during training and is fixed to an average value during testing.\n",
    "- _parametric leaky ReLU_ (PReLU), where $\\alpha$ is authorized to be learned during training (instead of being a hyperparameter, it becomes a parameter that can be modified by  backpropagation like any other parameter)\n",
    "- _exponential linear unit_ (ELU) outperformed all the ReLU variants: training time was reduced, and the neural network performed better on the test set\n",
    "    $$ ELU_{\\alpha}(z) =  \\alpha(exp(z)-1) \\quad if \\ z<0 $$\n",
    "    $$ ELU_{\\alpha}(z) =  z \\quad if \\ z\\ge 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It takes on negative values when $z < 0$, which allows the unit to have an average output closer to 0 and helps alleviate the vanishing gradients problem. The hyperparameter $\\alpha$ defines the value that the ELU function approaches when z is a large negative number. It is usually set to 1, but you can tweak it like any other hyperparameter. It has a nonzero gradient for $z < 0$, which avoids the dead neurons problem. If $\\alpha$ is equal to 1 then the function is smooth  everywhere, including around $z < 0$, which helps speed up Gradient Descent since it does not bounce as much to the left and right of $z<0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The main drawback of the ELU activation function is that it is slower to compute than the ReLU function and its variants (due to the use of the exponential function). Its faster convergence rate during training  compensates for that slow computation, but still, at test time an ELU network will be slower than a ReLU network.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- _scaled ELU_ (SELU) activation function: it is a scaled variant of the ELU activation function. If you build a neural network composed exclusively of a stack of dense layers, and if all hidden layers use the SELU activation function, then the network will self-normalize: the output of each layer will tend to preserve a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 during training, which solves the vanishing/exploding gradients problem. As a result, the SELU activation function often significantly outperforms other activation functions for such neural nets (especially deep ones). There are, however, a few conditions for self-normalization to happen:\n",
    "    - The input features must be standardized\n",
    "    - Every hidden layer's weights must be initialized with LeCun normal initialization. In Keras, this means setting ```kernel_initializer=\"lecun_normal\"```\n",

    "    - The paper only guarantees self-normalization if all layers are dense, but some researchers have noted that the SELU activation function can improve performance in convolutional neural nets as well\n",

    "self-normalizing, then ELU may perform better than SELU (since SELU is not smooth at z = 0).\n",
    "- If you care a lot about runtime latency, then you may prefer leaky ReLU.\n",
    "- If you don't want to tweak yet another hyperparameter, you may use the default $\\alpha$ values used by Keras (e.g., 0.3 for leaky ReLU).\n",
    "- If you have spare time and computing power, you can use cross-validation to evaluate other activation functions, such as RReLU if your network is overfitting or PReLU if you have a huge training set.\n",

    "**Saving and Loading**: When you save a model, the optimizer and its learning rate get saved along with it. This means that with this new schedule function, you could just load a trained model and continue training where it left off, no problem. Things\n",
    "are not so simple if your schedule function uses the epoch argument however: the epoch does not get saved, and it gets reset to 0 every time you call the fit() method. If you were to continue training a model where it left off, this could lead to a very large learning rate, which would likely damage your model's weights. One solution is to manually set the fit() method's ```initial_epoch``` argument so the epoch starts at the right value. \n",
